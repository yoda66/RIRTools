## RIRTOOLS

RIRTools is a collection of python tools used to fetch, store,
and process Regional Internet Registry published data.  The RIR statistics
exchange format requires regional registries to publish a current daily
snapshot of Internet number resource allocations.  These consist of
IPv4, IPv6, and Autonomous System Number (ASN) resources.

The filenames published are made available commonly on FTP servers
for each RIR, these being 'arin', 'lacnic', 'ripe', 'apnic', and 'afrinic'.
The file naming format for the latest data is always in this format:

    delegated-<registryname>-latest

with a hash verification file also published adding the '.md5' extension
to the existing filename.
